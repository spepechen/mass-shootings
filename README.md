# mass-shootings

I found out that Mother Jones has the most comprehensive record of mass shootings in the U.S. 
I am curious about the number of victims across 30 years, especially after Sandy hook and here is the animated <a href= "http://spe.neocities.org/d3-practice/line-graph/mass-shootings.html">line graph</a> made with d3.js. 

Some alternative datasets related to this topic:
